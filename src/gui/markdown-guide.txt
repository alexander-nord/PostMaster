                   A Quick Guide to Markdown Syntax!
                   ---------------------------------
          (psst: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)


  [1] HEADERS / SECTION BREAKS

      Header lines are indicated by having the first character of the
      line be a '#' (pound symbol for us oldies, hashtag symbol for
      you damn youngs!)

      The strength of the header corresponds inversely to the number
      of #s, as follows:

           # This Is the Title of My Post

           ## This is the first section

           ### This is subsection 1.A

           ### This is subsection 1.B

           ## Section 2


  [2] EMPHATIC TEXT

      Emphasis is generally added with asterisks, where the number of
      asterisks increases intensity.  For example:

           *This text would be ITALICIZED*

           **This text would be BOLD**

           ***This text would be both BOLD AND ITALICIZED***


  [3] EMBEDDED LINKS

      To link to a web page or a local image or document, place the
      text for the link (or, in the case of an image, the description)
      between square brackets immediately next to parentheses
      containing the desired link address.  For example:

           [The mountains of Philipsburg](~/Photos/Home.png)
